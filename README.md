# auto-readme
Generates a readme automatically with user input in node

## Description

This weather dashboard is a convenient way to search a specific city and find the weather for that place. It will log the current weather and five day forecast. The website uses the open weather api to search for the weather. The background of the website also changes dynamically based on the user's time. There are currently four time periods respected. Night, Sunrise, Day, and Sunset.

## Installation

Make sure you run npm init and npm i before you run the program so you have all the necessary programs.

## Usage
Once packages are installed, you can use node to call the index.js file and the console will prompt you to enter multiple inputs. Once you input everything, the generator will generate a new readme and create the markdown file.
